## The Zone of Proximal Development

The _Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)_ is a helpful model for writing your learning goals.  Productive learning goals will be in your personal _learning zone_, skills that are not easy for you but you can master in the time you have with the support you have available.   

Everyone's ZPD is different!  This is why you have the chance to write both shared and personal learning goals.
